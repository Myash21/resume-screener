- Problem Statement: HR teams often struggle to filter through large
volumes of resumes to find the best candidates. Your goal is to create an
AI-powered resume screening tool that analyzes resumes, ranks
candidates based on job requirements, and provides a shortlist of top
candidates.
- What We Expect: A solution that streamlines the hiring process by
automating the initial resume screening and reducing the time spent by
HR teams on manual reviews.
- Solution Guidelines: The system should demonstrate how AI can
identify the best-fit candidates based on predefined criteria such as
experience, skills, and job descriptions. It should include a user interface
for uploading resumes and visualizing candidate rankings.
